# Sha256
This project, written in Java, shows how the Sha256 Hashing algorithm can be considered to be a directed graph from the inputs to the outputs. Each bit is considered to be a node which is assigned once using an NOT, an AND, or an XOR. The graph is deterministic and the structure does not change for different inputs. Though the values the nodes are set to depend on the inputs. Apart from the input nodes which are set at the start, all other nodes have either one precedent (when a NOT operator is used) or two precedents in the case when an XOR or AND is used.
